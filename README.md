## stringConcat
# Design
once deployed, this contract has one external function which takes two string input and return a byte number of concatenated string

# Gas Cost 
used inline assembly in both internal conversion function and concat function, which significantly saved gas cost

# Security Consideration
currently not include irregular symbol & space checks. Will be added later
